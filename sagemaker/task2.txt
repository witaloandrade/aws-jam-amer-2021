 Task 2: Commit your notebook changes
Backgroud

In the previous task, you have successfully copied a S3 based notebook into your SageMaker Notebook Instance and tested out the function. The code works like a charm and you are ready to commit the code and call it a day.
Your Task

Now you need to commit the code change and save your work. Luckily, the DevOps team has already associated a CodeCommit repository with your Notebook Instance. All you need to do is to check-in your code. Like any git commit, you need to provide a summary of the code change. Once you push the code change, you can validate it in the CodeCommit repository.
