 Encrypt the Data Lake 
Your AWS Account has the following resources:

    A Data Lake S3 bucket with hundreds of objects, some of which are not encrypted.
    A Customer Managed KMS Key that must be used to encrypt at rest all current and future objects in the data lake. (There is only one in the account)
    An S3 Inventory file. For this challenge a single inventory CSV file is pre-created for you.
    An IAM Role (FixEncryptionRole) that can and should be used when fixing the encryption error

Requirements

Your job is to bring your data lake in compliance with policy by:

    Encrypting the existing objects in the Data Lake using a scalable method.
    Configuring the Data Lake S3 bucket so that new objects are encrypted by default with the Customer Managed KMS key.

Hints:

    Make sure you complete the requirements above, in order
    While the S3 Console allows you to change the encryption for a small number of objects, this method does not scale to millions or billons of objects. The challenge verification will not award full points if you don't use a scalable method to encrypt objects.
    Make sure you are using the generated KMS key not the S3 KMS key
