Background

You are the IAM Administrator for your AWS Accounts. You have two Projects: Red and Green that are launching and managing EC2 Instances in the same AWS Account.

Your AWS Account has the following resources:

    Two IAM Roles:
        ProjectRedRole tagged with Project = Red
        ProjectGreeRole tagged with Project = Green
    Two EC2 Instances:
        Red instance tagged with Project = Red
        Green instance tagged with Project = Green
    A Managed Policy: 'ManageEC2InstancesWithProjectTag' that is attached to the ProjectRedRole and ProjectGreenRole. This is overly permissive to start with and does not have any IAM Conditions for the Actions.

Requirements

Your job is to edit this policy document to meet the following three requirements:

    Restrict EC2 StartInstances & StopInstances actions to EC2 Instances with Project tag values corresponding to the Roles ProjectGreenRole and ProjectRedRole.
    Allow EC2 RunInstances only if the EC2 Instances and Volumes are tagged on creation with Project tag values corresponding to the Roles ProjectGreenRole and ProjectRedRole. Ensure that the only tag key allowed on creation is 'Project' with an exact case match.
    Ensure that tags cannot be changed on EC2 Instances and Volumes after creation.

Hint: it may help to save a copy of the original policy document before you make changes so you can always go back and start over.
Getting Test Results

After saving changes to the Managed Policy wait 20 seconds and browse to or refresh the VerifierUri from the Output Properties. This page displays results of test cases for the above requirements (green means the test passed, red means the test failed). When all tests pass you'll get the Challenge Answer at the bottom of the same page.
